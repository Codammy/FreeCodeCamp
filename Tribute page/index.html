                    pest-resistent plants.

                    <h4>1944</h4> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
                    flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate
                    on Earth.

                    <h4>1953</h4> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                    creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>1962</h4> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian

                    <h4>2005</h4> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                    genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
                    Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
                    animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.
                </li>

                    <h4>2009</h4> - dies at the age of 95.
