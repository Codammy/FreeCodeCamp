        <p>Java (with a capital J) is a high-level, third generation programming language, like C, Fortran, Smalltalk,
          Perl, and many others. You can use Java to write computer applications that crunch numbers, process words,
          play games, store data or do any of the thousands of other things computer software can do. Compared to other
          programming languages, Java is most similar to C.</p>
        <p> However although Java shares much of C's syntax, it us not C. knowing how to program in C or, better yet,
          C++, will certainly help you to learn Java more quickly, but you don't need to know C to learn Java. Unlike
          C++ Java is not a superset of C.</p>
        <p> A Java compiler won't compile C code, and most large C programs need to be changed substantially before they
          can run as Java programs.

        <p>The Java language was designed at sun microsystem over 16 year period culminating in its first release in
          January 1996. The developers led by James Gosling, originally set out to build a language for controlling
          simple home devices with embedding microcomputers.</p>
        <p>Thus, they started with the object-oriented concepts of C++, simplified it, and removed some of the features,
          such as pointers, that lead to serious programming errors. while the team may have originally had in mind
          compiling this language for a specific microprocessor, instead they developed both the java language and a
          hypothetical processor called the Java Virtual Machine or JVM rather than on a PC or sun workstation.</p>
        <p> The team's working name for this evolving language was ‚Äúoak‚Äù, but as it neared completion, they found that
          oak was already registered as a trademark. As the story goes, they came up with the name ‚ÄúJava‚Äù while taking a
          break at a coffee shop.

        <p>Object-Oriented programming (OOP) involves programming using objects. An object represents an entity in the
          real world that can be distinctly identified. For example a student, a desk, a circle, a button, and even a
          loan can all be viewed as objects.</p>
        <p> An object has a unique identity, <b>state</b>, and <b>behaviour</b> The state of an object consists of a set
          of data fields (also known as properties) with their current values. The behavior of an object is defined by
          set of methods.

      <div class="note">
        <p>OOP represents an attempt to make programs more closely model the way people think about and deal with the
          world. In the older style of programming, a programmer who is faced with some problems must identify a
          computing task that need to be performed in order to solve the problem. Programming then consist of finding a
          sequence of instruction that will accomplish that tasks. But the heart of object-oriented programming, instead
          of task we fine object-entities that have behaviors, that holds information, and that can interact with
          another.</p><p>Programming consists of design set of objects that model the problem domain. This is supposed to
          make the design of the program more natural and hence easier to get right and easier to understand. An
          object-oriented programming language such as JAVA includes a number of features that make it very different
          from a standard language. In order to make effective use of these features, you have to ‚Äúorient‚Äù your thinking
          correctly.</p><p> In object-oriented programs data is represented by objects, objects have two sections, fields
          (instance) and methods. Fields tell you what an object is. Method tells you what an object does. These field
          and methods are closely tied to the objects real world characteristics and behavior. When a message it
          responds accordingly as defined by its methods.
        </p>
        <p>Object oriented programming is alleged to have a number of advantages including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simpler, Easier, to read programs</li>
          <li>More effective reuse of code</li>
          <li>Faster time to market</li>
          <li>More robust error-free code</li>

        <p>An object-oriented programming language provides support for the following object-oriented concepts:

        <ul>
          <li>Objects and Classes</li>

          <ul>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Encapsulation</b> is a process of hiding or wrapping the data and
              the code that operates on the data into a simple entity. This keeps the data safe from outside interface
              and misuse. One way to think about encapsulation is a protective wrapper that prevent code and data from
              being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.</li>
            <li><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Inheritance</b> is the process by which one object acquires the

            <li>The meaning of <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Polymorphism</b> is something like one name many
              forms. Polymorphism enables one entity to be use as general category for different types of actions. The
              specific action is determined by the exert nature of the situation. The concept of polymorphism can be
              explained as ‚Äùone interface, multiple methods‚Äù.</li>

      <header>Java is platform independent </header>
      <p>Java was designed to not only be cross-platform in source form like C, but also in compiled binary form. Since
        this is frankly impossible across processor architecture. Java is compiled to an intermediate form called
        byte-code. A java program never really execute natively on the host machine. Rather a special native program
        called the Java interpreter reads the byte-code and executes the corresponding native machine instructions. Thus
        to port Java programs to a new platform all that is needed is to port the interpreter and some of the library
        routines. Even the compiler is written in Java. The byte code are precisely defined, and remain the same on all
        platforms.</p>
      <p>The second important part of making Java cross-platform is the elimination of undefined or architecture
        dependent constructs. Integers are always four bytes long, and floating point variables follow the <span
          style="color: crimson;"> IEEE 754</span> standard for computer arithmetic exactly. You don't have to worry
        that the meaning of an integer is going to change if you move from a Pentium to a PowerPC.</p><p> In Java everything is
        guaranteed.
        However the virtual machine itself and some parts of the class library must be written in native code. These are
        not always as easy as or quick to port as pure Java programs.
        Hence, Java is regarded as write once, run anywhere <b>(WORA)</b>.</p>

          Good programming style and proper documentation make a program easy to read and help programmers prevent
          errors.
          Programming style deals with what programs look like. A program can compile and run properly even if written
          on only one line, but writing it all on one line would be bad programming style because it would be hard to
          read. Documentation is the body of explanatory remarks and comments pertaining to a program. Programming style
          and documentation are as important as coding. Good programming style and appropriate documentation reduce the
          chance of errors and make programs easy to read.

          Every data type has a range of values. The compiler allocates memory space for each variable or constant

          we'll discuss shortly. The arithmetic operators in Fig. 2.11 are binary operators, because
          each operates on two operands. For example, the expression f + 7 contains the binary operator + and the two
          operands f
          and 7.</p>

          Java applies the operators in arithmetic expressions in a precise sequence determined by the

          1. Multiplication, division and remainder operations are applied first. If an expression contains several such
          operations, they're applied from left to right. Multiplication, division and remainder operators have the same
          level of
          precedence.
          2. Addition and subtraction operations are applied next. If an expression contains
          several such operations, the operators are applied from left to right. Addition and
          subtraction operators have the same level of precedence.</p>

          The parentheses are required because division has higher precedence than addition. The
          entire quantity (a + b + c + d + e) is to be divided by 5. If the parentheses are erroneously
          omitted, we obtain a + b + c + d + e / 5, which evaluates as

          <span class="header_take_note_of">Identifiers</span><br>
          Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and variables in a program.
          Identifiers are for naming variables, methods, classes, and other items in a program.
          Descriptive identifiers make programs easy to read. Avoid using abbreviations for identifiers.
          All identifiers must obey the following rules:
        <ul>
          <li>An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores
            (_), and dollar signs ($).</li>
          <li>An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). It cannot start with a
            digit.</li>
          <li>An identifier cannot be a reserved word. (See Appendix A for a list of reserved words.)</li>
          <li>An identifier cannot be true, false, or null.</li>
          <li>An identifier can be of any length.</li>
          <b>NB: <i>Since Java is case sensitive, area, Area, and AREA are all different identifiers.</i></b>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="header_take_note_of">Variables</span><br>
          Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program. Variables are for representing data
          of a certain type. To use a variable, you declare it by telling the compiler its name as well as what type of
          data it can store. The variable declaration tells the compiler to allocate appropriate memory space for the
          variable based on its data type. <br>
          <b> The syntax for declaring a variable is:</b>
          datatype variableName;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Here are some examples of variable declarations:</b><br>
          <code style="margin-top: -10px;">
    <span class="keyword">int </span>count; 		<span class="comment">// Declare count to be an integer variable</span>

 <span class="keyword">boolean </span> interestRate; 	<span class="comment">// Declare interestRate to be a double variable</span>
  </code>
          If variables are of the same type, they can be declared together, as follows:
          <code style="margin-top: -30px;">
<span class="keyword">int </span>count, age, amount;

          <span class="#Take_note">Named Constants</span><br>
          A named constant is an identifier that represents a permanent value.
          The value of a variable may change during the execution of a program, but a named constant, or simply
          constant, represents permanent data that never changes.
          The syntax for declaring a constant is:
          <b style="color: blue">final</b> datatype CONSTANTNAME = value;
          A constant must be declared and initialized in the same statement. The word final is a Java keyword for
          declaring a constant. For example, you can declare p as a constant

      <p>A Java application is a computer program that executes when you use the java command to launch the Java Virtual
        Machine (JVM). Later in this section we'll discuss how to compile and run a Java application. First we consider
        a simple application that displays a line of text. Figure 2.1 shows the program followed by a box that displays
        its output. The program includes line numbers. We've added these for instructional purposes - they're not part
        of a Java program. This example illustrates several important Java features. We'll see that line 9 does the the
        real work displaying the phrase test to Java Programming! on the screen.

          We insert <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 128);">comments</span> to <span
            style="color: rgb(255, 0, 128);">document programs</span> and improve their readability. The Java compiler
          ignores comments, so they do not cause the computer to perform any action when the program is run. An
          end-of-line comment need not begin a line; it also can begin in the middle of a line and continue until the
          end (as in lines 10 and 11). Line 2 is a comment that describes the purpose of the program.
          Java also has traditional comments, which can be spread over several lines as in üëá</p>
        <code style="background-color: #f7f7f7;" class="comment">/*This is a traditional comment. it can be split over multiple line. */
</code>
        <p><span class="header_take_note_of"> Line 3: Using Blank Lines </span><br>
          Line 3 is a blank line. Blank lines, space characters and tabs make programs easier to read. Together, they're
          known as whitespace (or whitespace). The compiler ignores white space.</p>
        <p><span class="header_take_note_of"> Line 4: Declaring a Class </span><br>
          Line 4 begins a class declaration for class test. Every Java program consists of at least one class that you
          (the programmer) define. The class keyword introduces a class declaration and is immediately followed by the
          class name (test). Keywords (sometimes called reserved words) are reserved for use by Java and are always
          spelled with all lowercase letters.
          NB: A public class must be placed in a file that has the same name as the class (in terms of both spelling and
          capitalization) plus the .java extension; otherwise, a compilation error occurs. For example, public class
          test must be placed in a file named test.java. The classname and filename must be the same (test.java).
          Class Names and Identifiers
          By convention, class names begin with a capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each word they
          include (e.g., SampleClassName). A class name is an identifier‚Äîa series of characters consisting of letters,
          digits, underscores (_) and dollar signs ($) that does not begin with a digit and does not contain spaces.
          Some valid identifiers are test, $value, _value, m_inputField1 and button7. The name 7button is not a valid
          identifier because it begins with a digit, and the name input field is not a valid identifier because it
          contains a space </p>
        <p> <span class="header_take_note_of">Line 5: Left Brace </span><br>
          A left brace (as in line 5), {, begins the body of every class declaration. A corresponding right brace (at
          line 11), }, must end each class declaration. Lines 6-10 are indented.</p>
        <p> <span class="header_take_note_of">Line 6&7: Declaring a method </span><br>
          Line 6 is an end-of-line comment indicating the purpose of lines 7-10 of the program. <span
            style="color: crimson;">Line 7</span>
          is the starting point of every Java application. The parentheses after the identifier main indicate that it's
          a program building block called a method. Java class declarations normally contain one or more methods. For a
          Java application, one of the methods must be called main and must be defined as shown in line 7; otherwise,
          the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will not execute the application. Methods perform tasks and can return
          information when they complete their tasks. Keyword void indicates that this method will not return any
          information.
        <p><span class="header_take_note_of">Line 8: Left brace for method declaration </span><br>
          The left brace in line 8 begins the body of the method declaration. A corresponding right brace must end it
          (line 10).</p>

          The System.out.printf method (f means ‚Äúformatted‚Äù) displays formatted data. each line of code after each
          conditional statement
          call specifies two arguments. When a method requires multiple arguments, they're placed in a
          comma-separated list.</p>
        <p>Method printf's first argument is a format string that may consist of fixed text and format specifiers. Fixed
          text is
          output by printf just as it would be by print or println. Each format specifier is a placeholder for a value
          and
          specifies the type of data to output. Format specifiers also may include optional formatting information.
          Format
          specifiers begin with a percent sign (%) followed by a character that represents the data type. For example,
          the
          format
          specifier %s is a placeholder for a string.the format
          specifier %d is a placeholder for an integer <small>e.t.c...</small>
          each followed by a newline character. At the first format specifier's position, printf substitutes the value
          of
          the
          first argument after the format string. At each subsequent format specifier's position, printf substitutes the
          value of
          the next argument.</p>

          keyboard. To perform console output, you simply use the println method to display a primitive value or a
          string to the console. Console input is not directly supported in Java, but you can use the Scanner class to
          create an object to read input from System.in, as follows, Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); For

          the condition in an if statement is true, the body of the if
          statement executes. If the condition is false, the body does not execute. We'll see an example shortly.
          Conditions in if statements can be formed by using the equality operators (== and
          !=) and relational operators (>, <,>= and <=).Both equality operators have the same level of precedence, which
              is lower than that of the relational operators.</p>
              <p>The equality operators associate from left to right. The relational operators all have the
                same level of precedence and also associate from left to right.
                The code <a href="#code" style="color: blue;">below</a> uses six if statements to compare two integers
                input by the user. If the
                condition in any of these if statements is true, the statement associated with that if statement
                executes;
                otherwise,
                the statement is skipped. We use a Scanner to input the integers
                from the user and store them in variables number1 and number2. The program compares
                the numbers and displays the results of the comparisons that are true.</p><br>

        <p>The operators +, -, *, /, and % can be combined with the assignment operator to form augmented operators.
          Very often the current value of a variable is used, modified, and then reassigned back to the same variable.
          For
          example, the following statement increases the variable count by 1:
          count = count + 1;</p>
        <p>
          Java allows you to combine assignment and addition operators using an augmented (or
          compound) assignment operator. For example, the preceding statement can be written as
          count += 1;</p>
        <p>The += is called the addition assignment operator. Table below shows other augmented
          assignment operators.</p><br>

          The ++ and -- are two shorthand operators for incrementing and decrementing a variable by 1. These are handy
          because
          that's often how much the value needs to be changed in many programming tasks. For example, the following code
          increments i
          by 1 and decrements j by 1.
          int i = 3, j = 3;
          i++; // i becomes 4
          j--; // j becomes 2</p>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line; margin-top: 0;">
          i++ is pronounced as i plus plus and i-- as i minus minus. These operators are known as
          <b> postfix increment</b> (or postincrement) and <b> postfix decrement</b> (or postdecrement), because the
          operators ++ and -- are placed after the variable. These operators can also be placed before
          the variable. For example,
          int i = 3, j = 3;
          ++i; // i becomes 4
          --j; // j becomes 2
        </p>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line; margin-top: 0;">
          ++i increments i by 1 and --j decrements j by 1. These operators are known as <b>prefix
            increment</b> (or preincrement) and <b>prefix decrement</b> (or predecrement).
          As you see, the effect of i++ and ++i or i-- and --i are the same in the preceding examples.
          NB: However, their effects are different when they are used in statements that do more than just increment and
          decrement.

      <article>
        <p>Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.</p>
   <p>java provides Three types of Conditional statements this second  type is loop statement .</p>
   <ol>
    <li><p><b> while loop:</b> A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. </p> <br>Syntax:<code class="code">
      while (boolean condition)
{
   loop statements...
}
    </code> </li>
    <li><p><b>for loop:</b>or loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping. </p><br>Syntax
    <code class="code">
      for (initialization condition; testing condition;increment/decrement)
{
    statement(s)
}
    </code></li>
    <li><p>do while: <b></b>do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of <i> Exit Control Loop.</i></p><br>Syntax
    <code>do
{
    statements..
}
while (condition);</code></li>
   </ol>
